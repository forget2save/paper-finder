# paper finder

An automatic search engine that can download PDF files and generate the summary which mainly includes the abstract. Paper finder is written in python and based on the free semantic scholar API and ArXiv. `demo.py` shows how to use this tool.

## goal

We want to read the papers which have following attributes.

- latest
- high citation
- influential authors
- on top journals or conferences

## there is a Plan B

Google Scholar is much stronger than Semantic Scholar, but its API is not free.
So I try to scrape the information on the Google Scholar with selenium.
